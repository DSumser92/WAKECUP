        <h2>Unique Blends</h2>

        <p>WakeCup takes pride in the estates and plantations that we work with. From the
            day of our inception, it has been our endeavour to reach out to the finest plantations from across the planet to bring you the finest blends. To that end, we source our beans from ecologically sustainable and responsible estates from around the world. Our collection is thus small but once you’ve tried our unique blends, you’ll never go back.</p>
